# Diwali_Sales_Analysis_Using_Python


The Diwali Sales Analysis project involved analyzing sales data during the Diwali season to uncover key trends, customer purchasing behavior, and product performance. Using SQL and data visualization tools, I performed data aggregation, segmentation, and trend analysis to understand how different products, categories, and customer segments performed during the festive period. Key insights were drawn regarding peak sales times, high-performing product categories, and regional variations in spending.
